# Max Rustle Demo

This is a React application demonstrating my development skills using React JS.
I've made this web application with a view to get my first job as dev.

It's a simple personal blog script, just a front-end part. Basically, it's a compilation of user interface features.

*refreshing the page at any route except url above results in 404 error; it could be solved via HashRouter, but it's just a demo.
